      <td><p>Since 1983, the Mechanical Engineering Department of UFSC has been
          giving emphasis in Precision Engineering by improving professor staff
          know-how and seeking specialized professors in this branch.</p>
        <p>            In 1986, the precision fabrication division of Machine-tools Laboratory
          had already a national recognition. That happened when LMP accepted
              the challenge to develop the first project of an ultraprecision
              machine-tool,
          characterizing a new research and develop line on the Mechanical Engineering
          Department.</p>        
        <p>            With the new structure of the academic formation options
          of Mechanical Engineering course, LMP, together with the Hardware Laboratory,
          Metrology
          Laboratory and the Projects Laboratory, has become the key for the
          practical formation of the academics of Precision Engineering option.</p>
        <p>Nowadays,
            LMP develops researches on conventional machining aiming at precision
            fabrication, ultraprecision machining, drilling, precision
            reaming, tools and processes monitoring, electroerosion, lapping,
          burnishing, turning with Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) inserts and project
          and construction
            of ultraprecision Machine-Tools. Through accords, there is a close
            contact
            with many companies and national and international research laboratories.<br>
