</h4>
<p>The Precision Engineering Laboratory &#8211; LMP &#8211; is
  one of the most nationally and internationally renowned laboratory at Mechanical
  Engineering Department of Federal University of Santa Catarina. LMP was established
  in 1990 due to the need of Mechanical Engineering course structure modernization,
making good use of the knowledge and experience from the old Machine-tool Laboratory &#8211; USIMAQ.</p>
<p>  The Precision Engineering Laboratory develops technological researches in
      conventional machining with defined and non-defined geometry tools, also
      aiming at precision
    and ultraprecision machining, emphasizing turning, drilling, reaming, milling,
    grinding, lapping, burnishing, electroerosion, flow drilling, conformation
    threading and others. LMP also develops researches in ultraprecision projects
    and machine-tool building scopes, mainly in microdisplacement and linear
      and angular micropositioning based on computer assisted aerostatic bearing,
      aiming
  machine-tools and metrology devices.</p>
<p>Among the main equipments available at LMP,
  there are conventional and numerically controlled lathes and milling machines,
  drilling machines, grinders, lapping
  machines, boring machines, one ultraprecision lathe, piezoelectric platforms
  for forces measurement on turning, milling and drilling, machining database
  acquisition system and equipments for results measurement and evaluation, as
  well as a full computational support structure.</p>
<p><br>
  LMP&#8217;s currently work team is composed by:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 
  3 Professors;</li>
  <li> 2 Doctor students;</li>
  <li> 6 Master students;</li>
  <li> 1 Research engineer (Master Engineer)</li>
  <li> 1 Technician;</li>
  <li> 1 Secretary;</li>
  <li> 1 Librarian;</li>
  <li> 20 Undergraduate students;</li>
</ul>
<p>LMP is supported by governmental resources (salaries of professors, technician,
  undergraduate students, master students and doctor students) and also by resources
  from research projects developed by partnership with companies that are administrated
  by the Engineering Education Foundation of Santa Catarina &#8211; FEESC. Beyond
  that, LMP develops research projects financed by Financing Foundation of Studies
and Projects &#8211; FINEP, similar to German DFG.</p>
<p>  Across accords and cooperative work, there is a narrow tie between LMP and
  several companies, like ROBERT BOSCH LTDA., EMBRACO S.A., ALCAN ALUMINIO DO
  BRASIL S.A., GRUPO GERDAU, AUGUST BECK GmbH, FLOWDRILL b.v., PROMETEC GmbH
and others.</p>
<p>  There is also an intense interchange between LMP and national and foreign research
  institutes like institutes from Kassel, Ilmenau, and Braunschweig Technician
  Universities, as well as graduation and post-graduation students bilateral
interchange between LMP, FhG &#8211; IPT and the Aachen Technician University.</p>
