  <td><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
    <p>        Despite the great progress achieved in the past years regarding
      ultra precision machining, there is still a lack of knowledge concerning
      the cutting mechanism and also about the excellent cutting conditions during
      machining with mono crystalline tools. The work piece material properties
      and its orientation and crystalline structure, the cutting tool material
      geometry and properties, the cutting fluid properties and machine-tool
      static, and the dynamic and thermal behavior have a great role on this
      process. These parameters interact with tensions, strengths and temperatures,
      in a way that these have, direct or indirectly, influence on the final
      work piece quality. A useful end essential tool in the understanding of
      phenomena that occur in machining is among others, therefore, the components
      strength that occur during this fabrication process analysis.</p>
    <h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
    <p>With this job it is objected a greater knowledge of the different work
      variables influence over the strength components during ultra precision
      machining, with a system developed and produced specially to measure these
      forces. This system allows the measurement of passive and very low cutting
      forces, in levels a lot inferior to 100 mN.</p>
    <h4>PROCEDURES </h4>
    <p>The passive and cutting forces behavior with the variation of the different
      machining parameters and work variables is systematically analyzed from
      feed variations, cutting depth, diamond cutting tool geometrical parameters
      and others important process variables. For this, machining essays are
      realized in infra red crystals (zinc sulfate, Cleartran&#8482; and germanium)
      and metallic materials (copper and aluminum alloy) with diamond cutting
      tools under different work conditions and the components strength behavior
      are analyzed.</p>

    <h4 align="left">RESULTS </h4>
    <p>The results obtained show that the strength measure system in the ultra
      precision machining has enough sensibility for a detailed analysis of the
      characteristic machining parameters in ultra precision operations. Based
      on the obtained results, more adjusted parameters can be determined to
      the optic elements production in each of the assayed materials, and analyzed
      the influence that the process variables have over the result.</p>
