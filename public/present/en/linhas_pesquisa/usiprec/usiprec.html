<td><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
  <p>In 1986, Precision Engineering Laboratory started researches on ultra precision
    machining area within the project and construction of a machine-tool to produce
    photocopy cylinders. This machine, endowed with aerostatic bearings and guides
    and employing monocrystalline diamond tools, allowed the attainment of surfaces
    roughness Ra around 10nm.</p>
  <p>      The following years were then dedicated to improve the knowledge acquired
      in the ultra precision area, through the study of machining technology
        bases with diamond tools and the development of machines and elements
        of machines
      for the ultra precision machining, as aerostatic bearings, positioning
        systems and linear guides, among others. It also had been studied problems
        related
      to contact lens machining with polymer materials, employing a specific
        machine for this use, and adapted to machine in two axles of a Moore
        lathe initially
      projected to produce computer hard disks. Also the conception and fabrication
      of devices and benches for general precision mechanics, as well as study
      of different precision machining processes (single cutting edge reaming
        and precision boring, among others) were the research topic.</p>
  <p>      In 1993 a doctor work was initiated focusing ductile machining materials
        with hard and fragile behavior, mainly infrared crystals. On this work,
        conclude in 1997, a deep analysis was carried through of the different
        machining parameters
        influence and work variables over the superficial and optic quality,
        as well as over the machining strength components. In virtue of the lowermost
        signal
        of force verified in ultra precision machining processes, there was the
        need to develop an ultra small strength values measure system based in
        the piezoelectric
        principle.<br>
