  <td><h4>INTRODUCTION </h4>
    <p>        In order to improve machining operation performance, technologically
      as well economically, cutting fluids are often used on different machining
      processes. The growing ambient agencies pressure to reduce the production
      impact over the environment and the elaboration of more strict laws, stimulate
      the development of all or any work concerned to reduce the fabrication
      processes ambient impact and contribute to achieve the clean production. </p>
    <p>        As consequence, dry machining and minimal cutting fluids use (MQFC) has
        been showing as a strong alternative to the fabrication processes. Among
        all machining processes, turning is one of the most utilized. New coatings
        that increase tool wearing resistance and allow high temperature machining
        contribute to these new tools application on dry machining.</p>
    <p>The ecological machining development study group work in LMP since 1996,
      where it has been developing researches on this theme. During this period
      several master works and one doctor work were developed, together with
      specific studies to partner companies, aiming to develop a good knowledge
      collection on this theme.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
    <p>This work development seek to evaluate the tool wearing manner, machining
      strengths and superficial quality obtained from turning process with hard
      metal inserts. In this study five conditions are evaluated concerning cutting
      fluids: dry machining, minimal cutting fluid use (MQFC), vegetal oil, mineral
      oil and molybdenum disulfide. The experiments are carried through to longitudinal
      cylindrical turning. </p>
    <h4>RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT </h4>
    <p>Aiming to gain technological information to the productive systems, inserts
      often used in the shop floor were chosen. </p>
    <p>        In this tests it is analyzed the tool wearing evolution, machining strength
        behavior (cutting force, feed force and passive force) and the surface
        quality obtained with each insert. In the final results it will be able
        to observe the fluid elimination influence on this process, once cutting
        fluid, viewed by the ecological aspect, has shown as a harmful agent
          against the environment. In this context, this work development is
          perfectly justified. </p>
