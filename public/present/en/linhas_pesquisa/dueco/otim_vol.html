  <td><h4>INTRODUCTION </h4>
    <p>        Cutting Fluids had been used in machining processes since anti&not;quities.
      The significant productivity raised documents, caused by the use of cutting
      fluids during machining, are related to 100 years ago. In 1883 F.W.Taylor
      proved that the cutting speed can be raised up to 30 - 40% through the
      interface work piece-cutting tool flooded with strong water flow. Since
      then, the cutting fluid development has been growing to achieve better
      perfor&not;mance on machining.</p>
    <p>        This development concern about economic and technologic aspects has forgotten
        the ecologic aspects. Three decades ago, motivated by constants problems
        manifested in machine operators, studies started to evaluate the hazard
        levels (for men and environment) of cutting fluids used in fabrication
        processes. Within this study lots of products were forbidden due to their
        high toxic level, while others less toxic were limited on their concentration. </p>
    <p>        As cutting fluids total elimination in machining processes is not possible,
          the optimization of its use on the various processes and the new nontoxic
          product development seem to be the best alternative to reduce the environment
          impact caused by its use.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
    <p>The studies in this area aim to fit the machining processes inside the
      environment demands that are gradually emerging by the need to reduce and/or
      eliminate the several sources of aggressions to environment. </p>
    <p>        Being cutting fluids one of the main fabrication processes pollution
          agents, its essential to focus the research on this area.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT </h4>
    <p>LMP, predicting the future Brazilian productive processes need to adapt
      itself to the international production exigencies, started in 1997 to study
      this area. In the beginning there are evaluated the real cutting fluids
      influences in the traditional machining processes with defined geometry
      cutting tools (turning, drilling, milling).<br>
      This evaluation is made on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Cutting Tool<br>
          o	Life time<br>
          o	Wear shapes and types<br>
          o	Cutting forces<br>
          o	Work temperature</li>
      </ul>    
    <ul>
      <li> Workpiece<br>
            o	Dimensional quality<br>
            o	Surface quality<br>
          o	Cheap shape and type</li>
    </ul>    <p>Through fluid type variations, application method and quantity applied
      on process, it is possible to establish the technological influences caused
      by these changes.<br>
      With this methodology it is possible to generate basic knowledge allowing
      the identification of the main benefits caused by cutting fluids in each
      process. That knowledge, if conveniently interpreted, is able to modify
      the cutting fluids characteristics reducing or eliminating the environment
      impact of the several fabrication processes.</p>
