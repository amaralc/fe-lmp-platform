<td><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4>
  <p>Drilling operation is one of the oldest processes utilized by men. During
    the Stone Age men made use of silex and bones as tools in some kind of manual
    driller (figure) that depended mainly on its executer skills. Registers that
    indicate that this operation was one of the first executed on metals has
    also been found.</p>
  <p> Even along all this years, drilling keep its importance within fabrication
      processes, being yet today of great importance for industrial processes.<br>
      This fact justifies absolutely the development of ongoing studies within
      the objective to achieve better technical and economical improvements on
      this process.</p>
  <p>      LMP&acute;s drilling study group exists since 1990, which has been developing
        continuously researches on this important operation.</p>
  <p>      During this time several master works had been generated, as well as
          uncountable specific studies for partner companies, which lead to a
        great pile of knowledge
          about this theme.<br>
          <br>
  </p>
  <h4><b>OBJECTIVES</b>
  </h4>
  <p>The research maintenance in this area aims to improve drilling process technological
    and economic efficiency, supplying technical support to current productive
    processes. New technologies development had also been searched, which might
    furnish the fabrication processes needs, which are greatly demanded each
    time.</p>
  <h4><b>RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT</b></h4>
  <p>Process based studies had been developed, creating basic knowledge and process
    parameters dominion.<br>
    At this moment the group is targeting your studies in new technological alternatives
    in order to keep or improve the operation efficiency, satisfying ecological
    exigencies imposed by the ambient agency.<br>
    In this way, studies include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>      Cutting Tools Materials</li>
    <li>        Coating Materials</li>
    <li> Cutting Tools Geometry</li>
    <li> Process Parameters</li>
    <li> Machining Strengths</li>
    <li> Cutting Fluids in Process</li>
    <li> Cheap Shape and Types</li>
    <li> New process conceptions<br>
            <br>
          </li>
