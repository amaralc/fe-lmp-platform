    <p>        In order to improve machining operation performance, technologically
      as well as economically, cutting fluids are often used on different machining
      processes. This product, however, is proved to be harmful to the machine
      tool operators&#8217; health and also to environment. In the past years
      the ambient agencies, the governmental laws, society and international
      market pressure and request has become more exigent, aiming the environment
      impact reduction caused by the several production sectors, among them the
      metal mechanic. As consequence, dry machining and minimal cutting fluids
      use (MQFC) has been showing as a strong alternative to the fabrication
      processes.</p>
    <p>        Drilling with helicoidally tools is one of the most utilized machining
        operations. New coatings that increase tool wearing resistance and allow
        high speed machining contribute to these new tools application in dry
        machining.</p>
    <p> The ecological machining development study group works in LMP since 1996,
          where it has developed researches on this theme. During this period
      several master works and one doctor work were developed, together with
      specific
          studies for partner companies, aiming to develop a good knowledge collection
          on this theme.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
    <p>The research maintenance on this area seek to evaluate the technological
      drilling aspects with fast steel helicoidally tools ( normal, special with
      TiNAl, TiN coating and coated with TiN + MoS2) and hard metal P40 ( with
      TiN coating, TiNAl) dry machining, minimal and different cutting fluid
      flow. This study aims to improve technological, economical and ecological
      efficiency on drilling process, providing technical support to the actual
      fabrication processes. It also aims new technologies development to supply
      the fabrication processes needs, more exigent each time.</p>
    <h4>RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT </h4>
    <p>Process base studies had been developed, creating basic knowledge and
      process parameters dominion. Actually the group is studying new technological
      alternatives available in the market to improve the operation efficiency,
      satisfying the ecological exigencies imposed by the ambient agencies. In
      other words, the studies are directed in a way to reduce the process ambient
      impact, sustaining and/or improving the actual process efficiency indexes. </p>
    <p><br>
        In this way, the studies include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>	tool material </li>
      <li>coating material</li>
      <li> tool geometry</li>
      <li> process parameters</li>
      <li> machining strengths </li>
      <li> process cutting fluids</li>
      <li> chip shapes and types</li>
      <li> new process conceptions<br>
