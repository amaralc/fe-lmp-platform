  <td><h4>INTRODUCTION </h4>
    <p>        During past years the energy consumes, environment pollution and
      industrial waste has awakened special attention by the public authorities.
      Motivated by the ambient organs pressure, governors have been elaborating
      stricter laws in means to protect the environment and preserve energetic
      resources. </p>
    <p>        Inside this context, LMP in 1996 started a new research line, the ecological
        machining, aiming the development of studies to contribute with cutting
        fluids use reduction and/or elimination on the machining processes, since
        this products are responsible for a significant portion of the environment
        aggression by the fabrication processes.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
    <p>This research line aims to evaluate the real technological influences
      over the main machining processes with defined geometry (turning, drilling
      and milling) caused by the cutting fluids reduction and/or elimination
      in this operations.</p>
    <p>In a general way the evaluation concerns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Technological aspects - machining processes efficiency</li>
      <li> Economical aspects - processes costs</li>
      <li> Ecological aspects &#8211; impact caused to the environment <br>
      </li>
    </ul>    <h4>          RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT </h4>
    <p>        The need to investigate this theme is growing as the technological
      aspects turn to be essentials inside the company&#8217;s production strategy.
      No doubt, dry machining is the best alternative to solve the problems caused
      by cutting fluids, when ecological and economical advantages get together. <br>
      Being it in initial investigation stage, there are many problems to be
      studied and solved. The first researches indicate that is possible to dry
      machining in many cases, meanwhile is not possible completely dry machining
      in all cases. </p>
    <p>        In those cases, however, is possible to reduce cutting fluids
      quantity reinforcing some fundamental characteristics to each process.
      Cutting
        fluids reduction as well elimination is the main goal of this study area. <br>
