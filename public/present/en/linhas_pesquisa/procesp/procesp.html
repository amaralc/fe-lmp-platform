<td><h4>DESCRIPTION </h4>
  <p> The limitation imposed on conventional manufacturing process by new materials
    leaded to the creation and development of the Special (or Non-conventional)
    Fabrication Processes.</p>
  <p>      On the last years, the investigation on this area has raised, always
    seeking new technologies. With this intention, it was created, in the Precision
    Engineering
  Laboratory (LMP), the Special Fabrication Processes Group (PROCESP).</p>
  <p> The PROCESP main objective, within the LMP background, is to promote the
    research in many areas, improving the activities in industry and in research
    organizations
    by providing trustworthy data collected on various years of scientific work.</p>
  <p> Nowadays, there is being developed works on two research lines, on Electrochemical
      Erosion area and on Electroerosion by Spark.</p>
  <p> On the same background as LMP, the PROCESP is always opened for receiving
        new ideas and works, which match the industries interests with our research
        centre
        interests. Our major objective is to raise the group and institutes know-how.<br>
