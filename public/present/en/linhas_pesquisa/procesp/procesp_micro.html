<td><h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
  <p>      The objective of this work is to develop a micro-drilling by anodic
    dissolution equipment and also to develop the process behavior knowledge
    by changing parameters.</p>
  <h4>INTRODUCTION </h4>
  <p>The materials anodic dissolution process is based on electrolysis where
    there is an atom-by-atom metal removal on an electrolytic cell. The process
    advantages are: the non-introduction of residual stresses and possibility
    of machining that is hard to do on common ways. The disadvantage is the limitation
    of only machining electricity conductor materials.</p>
  <h4>PROCEDURES </h4>
  <p>First, it was made the development and construction of a micro-drilling
    by anodic dissolution equipment prototype, simple and compact, see figure
    1.</p>

    Figure 1 &#8211; View of the first prototype</p>
  <p>This equipment allows the variations of a few process parameters, work stress,
    feed speed, electrolytic solution and electrolytic solution concentration.<br>
On a second level, it is intended to develop equipment with higher parameters
variation possibilities in order to permit deeper studies of relations among
micro-drilling by anodic dissolution parameters.</p>
  <p>      For process data collecting it was used equipment connected to a computer
        where the data is stored and processed for further studies. The parameters
        intended
  to be studied on this second level and the ones that can potentially be studied
  from the first level are: pH, temperature, electrolytic solution pressure and
  flow. Then it can be made a deeper study of the process.<br>
  </p>
  <h4>RESULTS </h4>
  <p>On the first level of this work, fine results were obtained on assays. On
    those, there were obtained micro-holes, see figure 2, with diameter of about
    1,7mm, with good wall circularity, parallelism and perpendicularism, and
    with rounded bottle.</p>
  <p>      On the second level it is intended to improve even more the results obtained
  on the first level, obtaining a better micro-holes quality.</p>
