<td><h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
  <p>      The objective of this work is to study the sharp corner wear behavior
    of copper electrodes, under pre-set rough and finish machining conditions,
    on electroerosion by spark.</p>  
  <h4>PROCEDURES </h4>
  <p>On an electroerosion by penetration machine (model ENGEMAQ EDM 200), there
    are made assays on SAE 1020 steel specimen, using electrode-tool of electrolytic
    copper.<br>
The specimens are prismatic bars, with rectangular section, and the electrodes
are cylinder bars with through hole for dielectric feeding. Initially, one of
the electrode extremities has a sharp corner.</p>
  <p>      The specimens are machined according to pre set input parameters (for
    rough and finish machining).
  The electrode sharp corner wear measurement is done indirectly, through cavity
  bottom rounding measurement (figure). A characteristic of the electroerosion
  process is the reproduction of the electrode shape on the part (the electrode
  wear is transmitted to the part).<br>

  </div>
  <p>For each parameters group, the electrode wear verification and evaluation
    is periodically accomplished, as the electrode advances against the cavity,
    through a digital camera that transmits an image, with the desired increase,
    of the studied region, directly to a computer.</p>
  <p>      The imaged is captured by an acquisition software, allowing it to be manipulated.<br>
      The cavity bottom wear measurement is made by a second software, specially
      designed for that purpose.<br>
  </p>
  <h4>RESULTS </h4>
  <p>There are traced behavior curves that relate the input parameters with the
    cavities measured rounding radius progression. Those curves are used as referential
    for sharp corner wear measurement.<br>
In set with the graphics, an analysis on the obtained results is made, always
based on literature.<br>
