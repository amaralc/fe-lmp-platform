  <td><h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
    <p> High speed end mills are greatly applied on metal-mechanics industry.
      Those tools are very versatile and make possible to execute an ample milling
      operation series. Slots, key grooves, profiles and cavities are some examples
      of operations that can be executed with end mills. Its grand utility is
      linked to its very easy acquisition, low costs and easy resharpening. This
      work&#8217;s main objective is to enhance basic information regarding the
      behavior of this type of tool in process. Amongst that information, it
      can be cited the efforts produced on slots opening, the forces behavior,
      the wear type and evolution and the influence of the process input parameters
      (tool geometry, cutting speed, feed, cutting depth, cutting width, cutting
      fluid etc).</p>
    <h4>PROCEDURES </h4>
    <p> The process of basic information obtainment about end mills use has as
      an initial step a bibliographical review on the theme on national and international
      specialized publications. From this research there will be made a database
      with information of the state of the art for this process.</p>
    <p>        On the continuity of this work, machining assays will be planned and
          executed, and those will aim the confirmation of known aspects or the
          search for new information
  and behaviors. For that reason, several equipments are available, such as:
          numerically controlled milling machine, piezoelectric platform for
          forces measurement, a
  complete data acquisition system, equipments for results evaluation and measurement,
  and an ample computational structure support.</p>
    <h4>RESULTS </h4>
    <p>The expected results are useful, so that the complex fabrication process
      by milling is known on a less empirical way and with higher scientific
      fundament.</p>
    <p>        It is hoped also of this work to be the beginning and the base for further
          developments on milling and cavity fabrication areas.<br>
