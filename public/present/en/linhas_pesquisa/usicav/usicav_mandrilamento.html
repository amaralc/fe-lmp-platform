  <td height="686"><h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
    <p>        Although boring tools rarely reach 15% of all machining tools,
      they are extremely important on process productivity. Since boring is often
      applied on parts final machining, that have already a high aggregated cost
      from several hours of previous machining, the rubbish making on this level
      is highly unwelcome.<br>
The objectives of this work are verification and comparison of dynamical characteristics
and influence on machined surface quality, as well on shape and dimensional precision
on boring equipped with tool runout and balancing system adjustment.</p>    
    <h4>PROCEDURES </h4>
    <p>The unbalancing of boring heads caused by cutting tool runout influences
      on machine vibration level, which influences on machined holes surface
      quality and shape precision. Aiming to contribute on precision boring process
      optimization, it is intended to compare the most known boring heads available
      for sale. All selected boring heads present tool runout adjustment, working
      on holes from 10 to 25 mm of diameter. Some heads have integrated balancing
      system. The materials used on assays are aluminum with 15% of silicon,
      cast iron GGG 30, SAE steel 1045 and SAE steel 4340.</p>
    <p>There are 5 interesting characteristics on this work.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> 
            Dynamics characteristics measurement: with the vibration level measurement,
            it is intended to evaluate the balancing system influence on machine spindle &#8211; head
            system vibration.</li>
      <li>          Influence on surface quality: evaluation of balancing system influence
              on surface finishing through machined test bars roughness measurement.</li>
      <li> Influence on shape precision: evaluation of balancing system
        influence on bored holes circularity.</li>
      <li> Regulation precision: for a specific
          diameter variation it is made an runout regulation and, after boring
          the hole, the final diameter is measured
      in
          order to compare the last one with the pre-meditated diameter.</li>
      <li> Regulation time: for a specific diameter, the necessary time to reach
        that measure is measured. Thus, such the head regulation as the necessary
    number of passes to reach the measure within the desired tolerance are considerated.</li>
