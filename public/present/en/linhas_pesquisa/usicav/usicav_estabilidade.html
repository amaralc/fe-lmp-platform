  <td><h4>INTRODUCTION </h4>
    <p>        The high speed machining is a fabrication process with a huge
      potential. Not only for increasing the material removal rate, but also
      for producing parts with better surface finishing, free from fin and residual
      stresses. These results are obtained only when the process is maintained
      in stability zones, free from regenerative vibrations.</p>
    <p>        There are many definitions for high speed machining. One of them, applied
          on speed ranges selection for machining performance tests, according
          ANSI/ASME norm
  (Hocken, 1991), is related to tool dynamics and machine head. It considers
          that the high speed machining occurs every time that the tool teeth
          passage frequency
  approaches a substantial fraction of the natural frequency of dominating vibration
  mode.</p>
    <p>        The regenerative vibrations are characterized by the system oscillation
          in one or more natural frequencies, without external forces interference.
          Their
    main
    source is an auto-excitement mechanism during chip formation, and they occur
    mainly under high removal rates. The consequences are the surface and dimensional
    quality worsen, the excessive tool wear or tool break, and the process productivity
    limitation. Their presences depend on the following variables:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Machine-tool and workpiece structure (rigidity, damping and
        mass);</li>
      <li> System vibration modes orientation;</li>
      <li> Cutting conditions (workpiece material, feed, cutting speed, radial and
    axial cutting depth and number of milling teeth).</li>
    </ul>    <h4>      OBJECTIVES </h4>
    <p>This work seeks a larger comprehension of the phenomena associated to
      the high speed milling process dynamics and leans to determinate conditions
      which lead the process to stability regions, allowing high removal rates
      and assuring machined parts high dimensional precision and surface quality.</p>
    <h4>PROCEDURES</h4>
    <p>The machining operations are influenced by the machine-tool dynamics and
      cutting process dynamics. The first one is analyzed using known methods
      and theories of structure dynamics and it is currently, from both mentioned
      dynamics, the most understood. The cutting process dynamics are less known,
      once the experimental and theoretical methods for their study are still
      in progress, and many issues weren&#8217;t yet answered.</p>
    <p>        Features from this work:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Determination of machine-tool-workpiece system dynamics characteristics
        for different material conditions, fixtures and structures.</li>
      <li> Application of process dynamic models and assays accomplishment for
        stability chart survey.</li>
      <li> Evaluation of machining forces influence and
          tool deflections on machined
    workpieces shape precision.</li>
