  <td><h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
    <p>        The objective of this work is to model, simulate and validate
      in computers certain characteristics of the milling process, like cutting
      forces and tool deflection.</p>
    <p> The development of computers with faster processors, the creation of
      softwares and environment of more sophisticated computational models, and
      the computational simulation appliance grow constantly in all engineering
      areas, including machining.</p>
    <p> The simulation aims to save time and resources, by studying and changing
      the process parameters without spending material, machine time, employee
      time etc. With simulation, it is expected to find more favorable regions
      for the process and to reduce the number of assays on shop floor. The simulation
      ought to give lines of direction for assays and point the subjects that
      should be boarded and modified.</p>
    <h4>      PROCEDURES </h4>
    <p>The models used on simulations are based on existing models in literature.
      There are made previous assays in order to calculate the wanted constants
      for the simulation and also to calibrate the model.</p>
    <p>        These constants are stored in a database for further study. The deflection
        may cause excessive vibrations in the process.</p>
    <p>        The input parameters for simulation are feed per teeth, cutting depth,
          cutting width, tool rotation, tool diameter and length. The obtained
          results are cutting
    forces and tool deflection.</p>
    <h4>RESULTS</h4>
    <p> With simulation it is expected to find more suitable regions for materials
      machining, reducing the number of required assays.<br>
There are made assays in order to validate and improve simulations, thus their
results can get the closest as possible of the reality.<br>
