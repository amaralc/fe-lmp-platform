  <td><h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
    <p>        This research main objective is to obtain technological information
      that makes possible to create machining strategies that minimize shape
      errors caused by tool deflection on end milling.</p>
    <p>On this work, the tool deflection major causes and the influence of cutting
      parameters are studied, and their consequences, such as shape errors and
      generated surface quality, are checked.</p>
    <p>An important industry segment, where this theme is essential, is the mode
      shop, where it is usually used millers with great balancing length/miller
      diameter relation, which makes them more susceptible to vibrations. Nowadays,
      the mode shops that use conventional millers spend big part of the process
      time on manual finishing operations in order to correct flaws on generated
      surfaces, raising the fabrication price.</p>
    <h4>      PROCEDURES </h4>
    <p>On this research there are used high speed millers and carbide millers
      for aluminum 6061 alloys and P20 steel machining.</p>
    <p>The main variables that might cause deflections will be varied, such as
      cutting depth, cutting width, feed per tooth and cutting speed. It is also
      very important to vary the tool geometry, in order to analyze how hard
      the L/D relation influences the deflection and may cause excessive vibrations
      on the process.<br>
      The forces are measured with a piezoelectric platform, fixed under the
      workpiece.<br>
      The tool geometry was conceived allowing the tool deflection to be measured
      right from the worpiece.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>RESULTS</h4>
    <p>There will be made a relation between cutting forces and the parameters
      that influence them, tool geometry and machined surface quality.</p>
    <p>The obtained results on this research will be used as basis for planning
      improvement or alterations on machining processes, showing the most influential
      parameters.</p>
