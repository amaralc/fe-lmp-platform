  <td><h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
    <p>The drilling process followed by threading is generally very applied in industry.
  Aiming specially fabrication costs reducing, the drilling and internal milling
  process (Bohrgewinde-fr&auml;sen) was developed. This process uses an only
  tool, which executes drilling, reaming and, in sequence, threading.<br>

      Drilling and threads internal milling tool</p>
    <p align="left">Magnesium has a growing importance in industry, specially
      due to its low weight (2/3 of aluminum&#8217;s weight).<br>
This work&#8217;s main objective, collectively with Institut f&uuml;r Produktionstechnik
und Logistik from Kassel University &#8211; Germany, is to improve this type
of tool performance on magnesium dry machining. Among analyzed topics, it can
be brought up forces behavior, wear types and evolution mechanisms, and the influence
of input parameters (tool geometry, cutting speed, feed, cutting depth, cutting
width etc).</p>
    <h4>PROCEDURES </h4>
    <p>The magnesium adhesion on the tool during dry machining causes a few problems
      that compromise the use of this process in threads. A tool premature break
      usually occurs due to drill flute blockage.<br>
The basic information obtainment process about drilling and threads internal
milling tools use, as well as magnesium machinability, begins with a bibliographical
review about the theme on national and international specialized publications.
This research generates a database with information of the state of the art of
this type of process.</p>
    <p>        Through assays and results analysis it will be possible to identify the
          tool break causes, providing a direct performance on the problems and,
          consequently,
  the process optimization. It becomes viable, thus, this process implement on
  industrial scale.</p>
    <h4>RESULTS </h4>
    <p>The expected results will be useful for the threads fabrication process
      to become more well-known and to be applied securely and with good productivity
      with better scientific fundament.</p>
    <p>        It is expected, also, for this research to be the beginning and the basis
          for future developments on drilling and threading areas, always aiming
          ecological
  machining and new technologies development.<br>
