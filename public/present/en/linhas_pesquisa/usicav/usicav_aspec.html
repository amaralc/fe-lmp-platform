  <td><h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
    <p>        The main objective of this work is to obtain technological information
      in order to compare actual production conditions with minimum fluid quantity
      machining, by means of forces behavior and tool life analysis.<br>
Beside tools, machines-tools and cutting parameters optimization, another emergent
world tendency is the companies concern regarding production technological aspects.
Therefore, with the growing pressure from environmental organizations to reduce
the industrial production impact on environment, and with the sprouting of more
and more severe laws against infractors, the importance to minimize the environment
prejudices caused by machining processes becomes evident.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>PROCEDURES </h4>
    <p>On this research there were used high speed steel (HSS) and carbide mills,
      coated and uncoated, all with same geometry. The assays were made on the
      way to guarantee the repeatability of machining conditions for all tool
      groups, varying only the cutting fluid type. On this study it was applied
      dry machining, ideal from ecological viewpoint, also the minimal cutting
      fluid quantity machining (mineral and vegetal) and machining with emulsion.</p>
    <p>        During experiments, the wear evolution on face and flank of every tool
          edge was monitored. The material used on assays was SAE 1040 steel
          and the cutting conditions
  for roughing accorded the manufacturer catalog.</p>
    <h4>RESULTS </h4>
    <p> This work has specific characteristics inherent to process, material
      and tool. However, it is possible to establish some important considerations
      that contribute to a more generic way with the studied theme.<br>
The use of emulsion is much spread out on the productive mean, however it is
observed on assays with this type of fluid that the tool life is reduced due
to high refrigeration rate which causes severe thermal shocks on cutting edges.</p>
    <p>        The employment of minimal cutting fluid quantity brought also good results.
          On assays with minimization, the tools had very good performance, although
          on machining
  with mineral oil as cutting fluid there was a tendency to better results.<br>
