  <td><h4>OBJECTIVES</h4>
    <p>        	One of the most employed materials for electrode-tool on electroerosion
      by penetration process is graphite. Specific characteristics of hardness,
      strain, microstructure and friction mechanisms require a differentiated
      approach of those applied on metals machining, when choosing tool geometries,
      tool material and cutting parameters.</p>
    <p> The objective of this work is to obtain a better understanding of industrial
      graphite cutting process, specially applied on milling process. The use
      of graphite is very important for matrix cut and injection fabricants,
      for electrodes fabrication for electroerosion. Those tools are extremely
      important for deep cavity machining or complex shaped cavity machining.<br>
    </p>
    <h4><br>
      PROCEDURES </h4>
    <p>The obtainment of basic information about industrial graphite machining
      begins with a bibliographical review on the theme, on national and international
      books and specialized publications. From this research there will be made
      a database with state of the art information for this type of process.</p>
    <p> From milling assays, comparing different cutting directions, the use
      or non-use of lubricant fluids and variation of cutting parameters for
      finishing operations, it is intended to obtain technologically useful results
      for matrix industry and electroerosion tools.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>RESULTS</h4>
    <p>The results of this research will allow the understanding of fabrication
      of electrodes or other components, from graphite, by milling, on a less
      empirical way, with better scientific explanation and direct application
      in industry. Moreover, it is intended to show that the use of graphite
      and its processing are economically viable, and also bring technological
      advantages.</p>
    <p> It is expected from this research to serve as reference for future developments
      on milling area and on cavity obtainment, with use of better tool materials
      and fabrication methods.</p>
