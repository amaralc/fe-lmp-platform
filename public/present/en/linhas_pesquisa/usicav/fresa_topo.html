  <td><h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
    <p>        This research area objective is to study 5 axes HSC (High Speed
      Cutting) end milling processes for mold industries.</p>
    <p>        The 5 axes HSC milling represents, for the modern industry, a
      rationalization way to the process. With 5 axes milling, it is possible
      to machine complex
          surfaces and also to have a better crest control and a better process
          rigidity, since
  the tool reaches deeper regions with smaller shank lengths. </p>
    <p> Very high cutting speeds generate an increase on rate removal, and the
      specific machining forces become incredibly smaller. Therefore, the process
      stresses
    are reduced, making possible to avoid thermals and chemicals modifies that
    might
    change the material characteristics, or cause problems on further operations.</p>    
    <p>        With 5 axes HSC milling, a technological alteration of the machining
          process sequence occurs because it is possible to reduce or even eliminate
          further
    operations (electrical discharge machining and some polishing operations,
        for example).</p>
    <p>From the cutting characterization on tool tip, to machine-tool
        development, because of the system structural and dynamical characteristics
        and specific
      software
      and hardware development, regarding the machine complex movements, the
      technological development is continuous<br>
    </p>
    <h4>PROCEDURES </h4>
    <p> For the process recital, the general machining technological aspects
      are studied. It is also defined specific cutting strategies for cavities
      milling, aiming at surface finishing optimization.<br>
All assays are made based on experimental planning, and analyzed through statistics
data treatment seeking the perfect comprehension of the results.<br>
A portion of the experiments is developed in cooperation with Fraunhofer Institut
f&uuml;r Produktionstechnologie, in Aachen, Germany, inside the same assays systematics.</p>
    <h4>RESULTS </h4>
    <p> After obtaining the basic information for industry needs, the technological
      diffusion is essential for the research continuity. It is intended to create
      basis for the industrial use of this research in Brazil.<br>
This work represents for the Mechanical Engineering Department/UFSC one of the
technological basis on formation of an Excellency Centre on injection molds area.<br>
