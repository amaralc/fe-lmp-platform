  <td><h4>OBJECTIVES</h4>
    <p>        	The objective of this work is to experimentally-theoretically
      determinate forces on face milling, in order to use them as input data
      on dynamic analysis by finite elements on low rigidity workpieces submitted
      to alternate efforts on milling process.</p>
    <p>        The forces study on milling is important for the machine-tool parts such
          as bearings, base, drive, guides, tool and workpiece clamping system,
          also on cutting parameters
  settings, wear mechanisms comprehension, vibrations amplitude prevision and
        an estimative for the obtainable machining precision prevision.</p>
    <p>        The finite elements method is greatly established as a powerful and popular
    numerical tool, initially acclaimed on structural analysis applications.
          At the present
    time, however, this method is being applied successfully in numerous areas,
    including machining.</p>
    <h4>        PROCEDURES </h4>
    <p> The cutting forces generated on turning and milling processes can be
      reproduced by models proposed by Kienzle and Altintas, among others.</p>
    <p>        The forces formulation on face milling woks as input data for finite
          elements in low rigidity workpieces, in which different cutting strategies
          are evaluated
  for vibration effects reduction.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>RESULTS</h4>
    <p>With the simulations it is intended to identify the suitable cutting strategies
      in order to reduce vibrations in low rigidity workpieces, still on project
      stage, or to allow the cutting processes to be reviewed and corrected before
      the process start.<br>
