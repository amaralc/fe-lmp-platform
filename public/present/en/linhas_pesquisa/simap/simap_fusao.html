<td><h4>INTRODUCTION </h4>
  <p>      The need for precision and trustworthy systems in acquisition by sensors
    of the signals generated in machining is fundamental in cases where the monitorization
    and process control are present.</p>
  <p>      When data are collected directly, there is a process stop problem so that
      measurements can be done. The direct measure, on the other hand, is done
      on-line, but the obtained data trustworthiness is lost. The solution found
      was a multisensor system elaboration, where each sensor becomes complementary
      to the other, increasing in the on-line system the obtained data trustworthiness. </p>
  <p>      The various signals caught by the multiple sensors, after been duly treated,
        are then combined through a neural net, whose answer can be used as a
        control and system reaction variable.<br>
        <br>
  </p>
  <h4>OBJECTIVE</h4>
  <p>Develop and implement a model based in connection, able to realize different
    signals fusion caught by multiple sensors, in order to obtain an answer variable,
    adjusted to a possible decision taking. </p>
  <h4>RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT </h4>
  <p>The unique sensor application in the on-line monitorization can show doubtful
    and incomplete data, beyond that, it can be insensible to a certainly process
    alteration. Employing multisensors, the sensor information can be weak and
    scarce, while the other can be safe and robust. The use of strength and acoustic
    emission sensors has shown to be efficient in the monitorization of metal
    cutting tool condition, mainly by the strong relation among signals with
    wearing and harming, beyond the great capacity to self-complement.</p>
  <p>      A neural net is able to suppress the deficient information of a signal
        related to a detected problem, incapacitating the entrance of it and
        overlapping
      it (through the weight alteration in connections among the net levels)
        with the entrance of other relevant signals. A generic and flexible model,
        making
      use of strength and acoustic emission signals, will be obtained through
        deductive knowledge of the already existing and available theory, and
        inductive knowledge,
      obtained through tests realization with controlled variables.<br>
