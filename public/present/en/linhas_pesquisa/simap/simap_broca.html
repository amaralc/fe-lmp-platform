<td><h4>INTRODUCTION </h4>
  <p>      The growing need to reduce the undesirable stop times, caused by tool
    changing due to its breakage, aiming the reduction of preventive maintenance
    costs, leads us to search the use of systems that can provide the real cutting
    tool situation. Generally, wearing measurement is done directly on the drilling
    tool through adjusted optical methods, having the necessity to stop the process,
    generating unproductive periods. Aiming to reduce such times, it is proposed
    the on-line monitorization of the tool condition on drilling process trough
    indirect measure of wear and damage.</p>
  <h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
  <p>To develop and implement an effective procedure to monitor on-line drilling,
    thence correlation indirect measurements (acoustic emission and strength),
    so it&#8217;s possible to detect drilling tool condition (wearing and/or
    breakage) in process.</p>
  <h4>RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT </h4>
  <p>More frequently used wears to establish the end of drilling tools life,
    which will be monitorized, are the flank, guide and transversal edge wearing.
    The detection will be measured through sensors located strategically in the
    machine, which will inform the damage thence feed force signals detection
    (FZ), torsion moment (MZ), and acoustic emission (EA) generated in drilling
    process. The obtained signals by the different sensors are duly treated to
    later tool life quantification.</p>

  <p>The main advantages on the research development are in fact that small cares
    in a process can take us to considerable gain of practical and technological
    effects. </p>
  <p>      This way, it is desired to obtain an efficient procedure to monitor drilling,
      for possible further applications on shop floor.</p>
