<td><h4>INTRODUCTION </h4>
  <p>      The actual productivity tendency is associated to maximum production
    with lower adjoined cost, involving the minimal human participation. This
    requires highly trustworthy systems. Besides that, the hard machining new
    materials arising, and new and expensive cutting tool materials, require
    a complete turning process optimization. It is not more admissible that cutting
    tool substitution is made before the suitable moment, generating costs with
    cutting tool and stopped machine times. </p>
  <h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
  <p>Inside this context, it is proposed a monitorization system by multisensors,
    with the intention to recognize and diagnose cutting tool condition over
    its machining life with metals in a CNC turning machine, from an algorithm
    of the resulting signal in the system exit. </p>
  <h4>RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT </h4>
  <p>The cutting tool condition is connected to a great parameters number, related
    to the machined material, cutting tool type, process conditions, etc. These
    parameters can be detected through sensors that, located in strategic machine
    spots, quantify indirectly the damages by the cutting forces signals, acoustic
    emission, and/or potency generated in turning process. The signals obtained
    by the different sensors are measured, treated (amplification, filtering,
    etc.), combined and analyzed (artificial intelligence algorithms), in order
    to emit information and instructions to CNC turning machine about cutting
    tool condition during production. The system monitoring efficiency in cutting
    tool diagnose will depend on collected information quality by the sensors,
    and algorithms used to analyze it, aiming the complete optimization and more
    convenient decision taking ahead detected damage type. Thus, multisensor
    system is capable to control cutting tool wearing in process, providing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> cutting tool condition on-line diagnoses</li>
    <li>machined workpieces superficial
        finishing improvement</li>
    <li>operation trustworthiness improvement with minimal
        human participation</li>
    <li>produced products quality increase</li>
    <li>fabrication costs reduction</li>
    </ul>
