<td><h4>OBJECTIVES </h4>
  <p>      With the purpose of obtaining machining data for further comparative
    analysis among metallic alloys with metallurgical alterations, in order to
    verify improvement on machinability, the Defined Geometry Tools Machining
    (GEODEF) develops machinability assays works, regarding criterions such as
    tool life,
    machining forces, surface quality and chip type and shape.</p>
  <p>      These works are made in partnership with GERDAU S.A. firm, which supplies
      the metallic alloys, and with a few defined geometry tool manufacturers.<br>
      Among assayed metallic alloys there are austenitic stainless steel alloys,
      mechanical construction steels and free cutting steels, among others.<br>

    <h4 align="left">PROCEDURES </h4>
    <p align="left">For the tool life analysis, assays are made with different
      cutting speeds, keeping other parameters fixed (cutting depth, feed, tool
      geometry and others). From pre-established measurements during the assay,
      wear accompaniment curves are written, which provide the tool life curve
      (Taylor).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">For the surface quality assay, the parameters Ra, Rz and
      Rt are measured, changing feed, cutting speed and tool nose radius.</p>
    <h4 align="left">RESULTS </h4>
    <p align="left">The results obtained on machinability assays showed that
      there might have machinability behavior variations with small permissible
      changes of metallurgical elements for certain material.<br>
The assays are made in universal lathes with speed continuous variation and in
parallel with it the metallurgical variables which affect the machinability are
monitored through assays of micrograph, micro-hardness and metallic structure
morphology and others.<br>
